## Smart Compost Management System
This repository is used for the documentation of our project.

### Introduction:
The smart compost management system is capable of monitoring and managing compost mixtures by adding air and water and other essentials when needed. 

Usually when making compost in household we dump kitchen scraps & leaves into a bin & we let it be converted to compost by keeping it for a long time. This process is called anaerobic composting. And there are few problems in this method. They are, it will take years to happen, anaerobic composting causes a higher output of methane gas, attracts rodents, and emits hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine. 

Currently it’s hard to find a proper solution for this problem in the local market. Our solution for this matter is aerobic composting. This method uses oxygen to feed the microorganisms that break down the compost. From this method usable compost can be created within a month if the essential requirements were given. And this method won’t create methane. 


We can measure the temperature, moisture, methane gas output of the compost mixture and these readings can be displayed through a web and mobile interface. Our system will recognize whether the compost mixture has been made or not by using the sensors and it will let us know when the compost is ready. According to the measured readings we can add water and control the air vents of our compost bin automatically.
